***What problem are you solving?***

Writing is a solitary art. This mobile app will allow writers to interact with other writers in real time, share ideas and be inspired by others' words.

***Who is the target user?***

This app is targeted toward writers, students and others who are interested in sharing writing prompts with their community.

***About the App***

Writable is a Web-based creative sharing app that enables writers to publicly share their warm-up "exercises" with nearby writers. What are "warm-up" exercises for writers? Imagine that a writer keep three hats, one full of kinds of people (like a nun, a police officer, you get it), another full of verbs, and another full of settings, or locations. The writer pulls a person, a verb and a setting out of the hat and writes one sentence using these often whimsical collections of things. That's the traditional way writers warm up.

Up until now, warm-up exercises have been a solitary activity. But given their explosive, off-the-cuff creativity and whimsical nature, these warmups are perfect for sharing, building community and inspiring other writers.

***How the App Will Work***

The app will allow users to create an account, log in, post writing exercises (limited to 300 words, max), and share them with the writing community. These exercises will be displayed in a stream, with the most "popular" posts on the top. Users will also be able to search posts to read writing exercises. They will also be able to leave comments on and upvote others' posts.

***Requirements***

This app will require:

-Merriam-Webster API: The M-W.com API will allow the app to generate random collections of people, verbs and places, which will serve as writing prompts for users
-The ability to log into the app and save writing exercises
-A view of most popular writing exercises
-The ability to comment on others' exercises
-The ability to "upvote" or "like" others' exercises
-The ability to search exercises based on keywords or topics (i.e. if you want to find others' exercises about San Francisco, you should be able to search "San Francisco" and see a list of results)

***User Story***

Leslie is a writing student at UCSF. Her professor has told her to practice as much as she can--but Leslie doesn't like the idea of working alone constantly. She's heard of writing prompts, and has had the idea of sharing these prompts with others, but she's still not sure where to connect with a community that's interested in and reading and giving feedback on the prompts she produces.

This app will give Leslie a place to post her prompts, get feedback, read others' prompts--and turn writing into a community process rather than an isolated one.
