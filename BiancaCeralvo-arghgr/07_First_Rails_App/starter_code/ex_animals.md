###Time: 30 min

####Topics:

*	Rails
*	Scaffolding

####Task Instruction:

*	Create a new application called rails_animals.
*	Create a rails scaffold and run the server:
``` bash
> rails generate scaffold Animal name:string animal_type:string available:boolean breed:string age:integer
> rake db:migrate
> rails server
```
*   Explore the Rails folders and files
*   Make changes to the files and see what happens.
*   Add some animals to the animal directory.

HINTS

* HINT: Be sure to restart the server every time you make a change if it doesn't work.
* HINT: Remember to use Sublime text to open the Rails project *directory*!
* HINT: If you have trouble you can't solve, for now simply delete the rails_animals directory and start over.
