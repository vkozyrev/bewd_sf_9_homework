...a software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user written code.

&dash; via Wikipedia
You use libraries, frameworks use you.

$ rails new app_name
```

*   This will create a project folder and some useful files for you.
*   Don't forget to cd into your new directory before you move on.

####Running the server.

```bash
$ rails server
```

* Now you can visit http://localhost:3000/ and see your app.
