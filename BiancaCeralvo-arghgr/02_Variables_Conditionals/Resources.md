#Resources - Variables and Conditional Logic

###Cheat Sheet

__Variables__


```ruby
 real_name = "Bruce Wayne"
 secret_identity = "Batman"
```

*String interpolation aka Adding Variables to String*

```ruby
puts "We just spilled the beans #{real_name} is #{secret_identity}"
```

> We just spilled the beans Bruce Wayne is Batman

__Arithmetic Operators__

| Operator | Description | Example (a = 4 and b = 2) | Output |
| ------------- |:-------------| :-----|:-----|
| ```+```      | Addition (add left to right, give result) |  ```puts a + b```  | 6 |
| ```-```      |  Subtraction (subtract left from right, give result)    |  ```puts a - b```  | 2 |
| ```*``` | Multiplication (multiply left by right, give result)   | ```puts a * b```  | 8 |
| ```/``` | Division (divide left by right, give result)  | ```puts a / b``` | 2 |
| ```%``` | Modulus (divide left by right, give remainder) | ```puts a % b```  | 0 |
| ```**``` |Exponent (multiply left by left, right times, give result)  | ```puts a ** b``` | 16 |


__Conditionals Operators__

| Operator        | Description  | Example         (a = 4 and b = 2)  | Evaluated As |
| -------------   |:-------------| :-----|:-----|
| == | Equality |  a == b | false |
| != |  Not Equal | a != b | true  |
| >  | Greater than | a > b | true  |
| < | Less than |a < b | true  |
| >= |Greater than  or equal to | a <= b | false |
| <= |Less than or equal to | a <= b | false |
| <=> |Same value? return 0, less than? return -1, greater than? return 1 | a <=> b | 1 |
| .eql? | same value and same type?| 1.eql?(1.0)| false |


__If Syntax__

```ruby
if (condition)
  code to execute if the condition is true
end
```

```ruby
if var == 20
   puts "Variable is 20"
end
```

__If Else Syntax__

```ruby
if var == 20
   puts "Variable is 20"
else
   puts "Variable is another number"
end
```

__If Else If Syntax__

```ruby
if var == 20
   print "Variable is 20"
elsif var == 30
   print "Variable is 30"
else
   print "Variable is something else"
end
```

__Methods__

__Simple Methods__

```ruby
def method_name
end
```

__Method w/ Parameters__

```ruby
def say (something)
      puts "They said " + something.to_s
end

 say ("Hello")

=> They said Hello
```

Note: This can also be written as ```"They said #{something}"```. This is called "string interpolation". It's the Ruby Way. Look it up on a search engine for more information!


__Running .rb from the terminal__

```
	ruby file_name.rb
```
