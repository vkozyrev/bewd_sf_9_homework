#BEWD - Collections & Loops

###Cheat Sheet

####Arrays

__Creating Arrays__

```ruby
my_array = ["Apples", "Oranges", "Pears"]
```

> ["Apples", "Oranges", "Pears"]

```ruby
my_array = Array.new
```

> []

```ruby
Array.new(3)
```  

> [nil, nil, nil]

```ruby
Array.new(3, "BEWD")
```

> ["BEWD", "BEWD", "BEWD"]

__Assessing Elements__

```ruby
arr = ["NYC", "LDN", "LA", "SF", "BOS", "BER"]
arr[0]
arr[100]
arr[-3]
```

> NYC

> nil

> SF

```ruby
arr[2, 3] #=> [3, 4, 5]
```

> ["LA", "SF", "BOS"]

```ruby
arr[1..4]
```

> [LDN, LA, SF, BOS]

####Hashes

```ruby
GA_Markets = { "New York City"=>"NYC", "London"=>"LDN", "Los Angeles"=>"LA", "San Francisco"=>"SF", "Boston"=>"BOS", 	"Berlin"=>"BER" }

GA_Markets["London"]
```

> "LDN"

```ruby
super_heros = { batman: "Bruce Wayne", superman: "Clark Kent", spiderman: "Peter Parker"}

super_heros[:superman]
```

> "Clark Kent"

####Loops

__Iterator loop__

```ruby
4.times do
  puts "This will be printed 4 times"
end
```

> This will be printed 4 times

> This will be printed 4 times

> This will be printed 4 times

> This will be printed 4 times

__Each Loop__

```ruby
# A list of GA Courses
courses = [ "FEWD", "BEWD", "CSF" ]

names.each do|n|
    puts "GA has a course on #{n}"
end
```

> GA has a course on FEWD

> GA has a course on BEWD

> GA has a course on CSF
